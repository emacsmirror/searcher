# searcher
> Searcher in pure elisp

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/searcher/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/searcher/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Similar to `ag`, `rg`, `grep`, etc. But written in pure elisp.

## üí° Searching Algorithm

You can change the search type by tweaking the variable `searcher-search-type`
to one of the following value.

* `regex` - Use normal regular expression by default.
* `regex-fuzzy` - Fuzzy regular expression from [ivy--regex-fuzzy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/b65e401c22ec56a008b00f651cd9536caf593d43/ivy.el#L2906).
* `flx` - Fuzzy searching the same as `regex-fuzzy` and uses [flx](https://github.com/lewang/flx)
to score the candidates.
(You would need to install [flx](https://github.com/lewang/flx))

If you think the fuzzy is too fuzzy and not perform accuracy. Try to raise/lower
`searcher-flx-threshold` value depends on the scoring you want.
